/**
 * Tests for security-review.mjs's pure verdict logic.
 *
 * The property under test: the model's stated `verdict` is NOT trusted over
 * the `findings[]` it carries. A response that names a `blocker` — "must fix
 * before push" — while stamping "approve" is self-contradictory, and the
 * severity wins. `important` deliberately does not flip; see validateVerdict.
 *
 * Run: `node --test scripts/security-review.test.mjs`
